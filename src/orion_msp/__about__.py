    "Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning. "
    "A tabular foundation model combining multi-scale sparse attention with "
    "Perceiver-style memory for efficient in-context learning on tabular data. "
    "Processes features at multiple resolutions (scales 1, 4, 16) using windowed, "
    "global, and random attention patterns, reducing computational complexity "
    "while capturing hierarchical feature interactions."
